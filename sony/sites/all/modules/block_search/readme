If you have a handful of custom or manually created blocks in 
your site, administering them from core block management 
screen is sometimes painful. If you ever wished that there should 
be a search functionality for searching contents of custom blocks, 
this module is for you!
Block Search module provides an alternative way of managing 
blocks. It provides a tabular list of blocks in a theme independent 
page. It also provides a simple search functionality. Using this 
functionality administrators can search blocks with matching 
search phrases in titles or body areas. Tabular blocks list 
contains handy edit, delete & manage regions links.
This module does not add any tables on its own. Also it uses edit, 
delete & set regions functionalities from Drupal core. The only 
two most important functions this module provides are:
1.	Ability to search custom blocks based on their content
2.	A theme independent page for managing blocks
